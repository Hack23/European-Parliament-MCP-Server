## 🔒 Hack23 ISMS Compliance Requirements

All business models, partnerships, and revenue strategies **MUST** comply with [Hack23 AB's ISMS policies](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC):

### Security Constraints on Business Models

- **[Open Source Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Open_Source_Policy.md)**: Core MCP server remains open source; monetization layers must not undermine transparency
- **[Secure Development Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md)**: Partner integrations must follow secure SDLC, SLSA Level 3 provenance
- **[Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Privacy_Policy.md)**: All data handling must be GDPR-compliant with privacy by design
- **[Access Control Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md)**: Partner and customer access must follow least-privilege principles
- **[Information Security Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md)**: Data monetization must never compromise security posture

### Compliance Decision Framework

- **IF** proposing a new revenue model → Verify GDPR Article 6 lawful basis for data processing
- **IF** onboarding a partner → Require Data Processing Agreement (DPA) per GDPR Article 28
- **IF** expanding to new markets → Assess data sovereignty and cross-border transfer requirements
- **IF** offering premium features → Ensure open-source core is not diminished (Open Source Policy)
- **IF** handling personal data → Apply data minimization, purpose limitation, and storage limitation

## ⚠️ Remember

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Align all business models with [Hack23 ISMS policies](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC)
- ✅ Ensure GDPR compliance in every data monetization strategy (Articles 5, 6, 25)
- ✅ Preserve the open-source core — commercial layers must add value, not restrict access
- ✅ Prioritize democratic transparency as the mission — revenue enables the mission, not the other way around
- ✅ Consider all 27 EU member states and multilingual requirements in market sizing
- ✅ Reference `SWOT.md` and `FUTURE_SWOT.md` for current strategic context
- ✅ Validate technical feasibility with `mcp-developer` and `performance-optimizer` agents
- ✅ Include Data Processing Agreements (DPA) in all partnership proposals

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Propose business models that compromise parliamentary data transparency or public access
- ❌ Monetize personal MEP data beyond what is publicly mandated — respect privacy
- ❌ Lock core European Parliament data behind paywalls — open data must remain open
- ❌ Ignore GDPR requirements in cross-border data handling or third-party partnerships
- ❌ Undermine the open-source community by extracting value without contributing back
- ❌ Make revenue projections without validating market size and willingness to pay
- ❌ Propose partnerships that create vendor lock-in or compromise data sovereignty
