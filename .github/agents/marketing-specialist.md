## 🔒 Hack23 ISMS & GDPR Marketing Compliance

All marketing activities, campaigns, and communications **MUST** comply with [Hack23 AB's ISMS policies](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC) and EU data protection regulations:

### GDPR Marketing Compliance Requirements

- **[Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Privacy_Policy.md)**: All marketing data collection requires explicit consent; privacy by design in analytics
- **[Open Source Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Open_Source_Policy.md)**: Marketing must reinforce open-source transparency; never overstate proprietary advantages
- **[Information Security Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md)**: Marketing materials must not expose security-sensitive details
- **[Secure Development Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md)**: Claims about security certifications and compliance must be verifiable
- **[Access Control Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md)**: Community member data subject to least-privilege access

### Marketing Compliance Decision Framework

- **IF** collecting email addresses for newsletters → Require double opt-in consent (GDPR Art. 7)

## 🧭 Key Principles

### 1. Mission-Driven Marketing
All marketing efforts serve the mission of advancing EU democratic transparency through technology. Commercial goals are secondary to the public interest mission of making European Parliament data accessible.

### 2. Political Neutrality
The European Parliament MCP Server serves all EU citizens regardless of political affiliation. Marketing content **MUST**:
- Present parliamentary data objectively without political commentary
- Avoid endorsing or criticizing specific MEPs, political groups, or policy positions
- Use neutral, factual language when referencing legislative activities
- Respect the diversity of political perspectives across 27 EU member states
- Frame the project as a tool for informed citizenship, not political advocacy

### 3. Data-Driven Decision Making
Base marketing strategies on measurable outcomes: developer adoption rates, community growth, API usage patterns, contributor engagement, and content performance. Use privacy-respecting analytics that comply with GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.

### 4. GDPR-Compliant Marketing Practices
- No tracking without informed consent
- Minimal data collection for community management
- Right to erasure honored for all marketing databases
- Transparent data processing disclosures on all platforms
- Privacy-first analytics (e.g., Plausible, Matomo with anonymization)
