### **ROI Metrics**

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Cost of free security tools | $0/year | Maximum ROI |
| Vulnerabilities auto-detected | 95%+ of known CVEs | Prevents costly incidents |
| Build provenance coverage | 100% (SLSA Level 3) | Supply chain trust |
| Test coverage | 80%+ | Defect prevention |
| Time to vulnerability patch | < 7 days (high severity) | Reduced exposure window |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | 8.5+/10 | Community trust signal |

## 🛡️ Risk-Based Budget Allocation

| Risk Priority | Area | Allocation | Justification |
|--------------|------|------------|---------------|
| 🔴 Critical | Supply chain security | 30% of dev time | Highest impact attack vector |
| 🟠 High | Input validation & testing | 25% of dev time | Prevents runtime exploits |
| 🟡 Medium | Security documentation | 20% of dev time | Compliance and transparency |
| 🟡 Medium | Code review & quality | 15% of dev time | Defect prevention |
| 🟢 Low | Security monitoring | 10% of dev time | Automated detection |

## 📋 Operational Cost Optimization

### **🆓 Leveraging Free Security Tools**

| Tool | Purpose | Alternative (Paid) | Savings |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD | Jenkins, CircleCI | $50-500/mo |
| Dependabot | Dependency updates | Snyk Pro, Mend | $100-1000/mo |
| CodeQL | Static analysis | SonarCloud Pro, Checkmarx | $200-2000/mo |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | Security posture | Custom assessment | $500-5000/assessment |
| npm audit | Vulnerability scan | Snyk, WhiteSource | $100-500/mo |
| FOSSA | License compliance | Black Duck | $500-5000/mo |

### **💡 Cost Optimization Strategies**

1. **Automate Everything:** CI/CD handles security scanning automatically
2. **Shift Left:** Catch issues in development, not production
3. **Community Leverage:** Open source benefits from community security reviews
4. **Documentation as Code:** Security docs maintained alongside code
5. **Free Tier Maximization:** Use GitHub's comprehensive free offering for public repos

## 🔄 Financial Contingency

### **🚨 Security Incident Cost Estimates**

| Scenario | Estimated Cost | Mitigation |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Critical vulnerability fix | 8-16 hours dev time | Automated detection, rapid response |
| Supply chain compromise | 16-40 hours dev time | SLSA, SBOM, provenance verification |
| npm package recall | 4-8 hours dev time | Automated publishing, version management |
| Security advisory creation | 2-4 hours dev time | Template-based process |
| Full security audit | 40-80 hours dev time | Continuous assessment reduces need |

### **📊 Contingency Reserve**

| Reserve Type | Allocation | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Critical response | 20 hours/quarter | Zero-day and critical CVE response |
| Routine maintenance | 10 hours/month | Dependency updates, monitoring |
| Documentation updates | 5 hours/quarter | ISMS compliance maintenance |
