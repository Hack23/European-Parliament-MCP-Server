## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the European Parliament MCP Server project seriously. If you have found a potential security vulnerability, we kindly ask you to report it privately, so that we can assess and address the issue before it becomes publicly known.

Our vulnerability management process is governed by our **[Information Security Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md)** and follows industry best practices for responsible disclosure.

### 🔍 What Constitutes a Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in the project that can be exploited to compromise the security, integrity, or availability of the system or its data. Examples of vulnerabilities include, but are not limited to:

- **🔓 Unauthenticated access** to sensitive European Parliament data
- **💉 Injection attacks** (SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection)
- **🔐 Authentication/authorization bypass** in MCP protocol implementation
- **🌐 API security issues** (rate limit bypass, parameter manipulation)
- **🔒 Cryptographic weaknesses** (weak algorithms, improper key management)
- **📊 GDPR violations** (unauthorized data exposure, insufficient data protection)
- **⚡ Denial of service** vulnerabilities in API endpoints
- **🔗 Supply chain attacks** through compromised dependencies

### 🛡️ How to Privately Report a Vulnerability using GitHub

Please follow these steps to privately report a security vulnerability:

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the [European-Parliament-MCP-Server repository](https://github.com/Hack23/European-Parliament-MCP-Server).
2. Under the repository name, click **Security**. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the dropdown menu, and then click **Security**.
3. In the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click **Advisories**.
4. Click **Report a vulnerability** to open the advisory form.
5. Fill in the advisory details form. Provide as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue:
   - **Title**: Brief description of the vulnerability
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation including:
     - Affected components (API endpoints, authentication, etc.)
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Potential impact (especially GDPR/data protection concerns)
     - Suggested mitigation (if any)
   - **Severity**: Your assessment of the vulnerability severity
   - **CVE ID**: If already assigned
6. At the bottom of the form, click **Submit report**.

After you submit the report, the maintainers of the European-Parliament-MCP-Server repository will be notified. They will review the report, validate the vulnerability, and take necessary actions to address the issue. You will be added as a collaborator and credited for the security advisory.

### ⏱️ Disclosure Timeline

Upon receipt of a vulnerability report, our team will:

1. **Acknowledge** the report within **48 hours**
2. **Validate** the vulnerability within **7 days**
3. **Assess** GDPR/data protection implications within **7 days**
4. **Develop and release** a patch or mitigation within **30 days**, depending on the complexity and severity of the issue
5. **Publish** a security advisory with a detailed description of the vulnerability and the fix
6. **Notify** affected users if there is a potential data breach (as required by GDPR)

### 🏆 Recognition and Anonymity

We appreciate your effort in helping us maintain a secure and reliable project. If your report results in a confirmed security fix, we will recognize your contribution in the release notes and/or a public acknowledgment, unless you request to remain anonymous.
