/**
 * Shared utilities for feed tool handlers.
 *
 * The EP Open Data Portal feed endpoints have several known behaviours
 * that require graceful handling:
 *
 * 1. **HTTP 404** — returned during recess or low-activity periods when
 *    no records were updated within the requested timeframe.
 * 2. **HTTP 204 No Content** — returned by feeds that have no updates
 *    (empty body, no Content-Type header).  Handled by baseClient.
 * 3. **HTTP 200 with error-in-body** — the EP API sometimes returns
 *    HTTP 200 with a JSON body containing an `error` field (e.g.
 *    `"error": "404 Not Found from POST …"`).  This happens when the
 *    EP API's internal enrichment/POST step fails.  These look like
 *    successful responses but contain no `data` array.
 *
 * These helpers convert all three cases into uniform MCP responses so
 * downstream consumers always receive the same envelope shape.
 *
 * ## Uniform feed response envelope
 *
 * Every feed handler emits the same body shape, regardless of whether
 * the upstream call succeeded, returned no data, or failed in-band:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "status": "operational" | "degraded" | "unavailable",
 *   "generatedAt": "2026-04-18T07:12:00Z",
 *   "items": [],
 *   "itemCount": 0,
 *   "reason": "Optional string when status !== 'operational'",
 *   "data": [],
 *   "@context": [],
 *   "dataQualityWarnings": []
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * - `status` — `"operational"` for fresh data without warnings,
 *   `"degraded"` for fresh data accompanied by data-quality warnings,
 *   `"unavailable"` when the upstream returned a 404 / error-in-body /
 *   empty body and we have no fresh data to report.
 * - `items` — alias for `data`; the canonical name in the contract.
 * - `data` — always normalized to the same array as `items` so consumers
 *   reading the legacy field always see an array.
 * - `itemCount` — length of `items`.
 * - `generatedAt` — ISO-8601 timestamp of when the response was built
 *   (not "last upstream success" — that would require state/caching).
 * - `reason` — present only when `status !== "operational"`.
 *
 * The legacy `data` / `@context` / `dataQualityWarnings` fields are
 * preserved so existing consumers continue to work unchanged.
 *
 * Reserve HTTP 4xx / 5xx for genuine transport errors (auth, rate
 * limit, gateway timeout, endpoint removed permanently). Empty
 * timeframes / temporary upstream outages always yield HTTP 200 with
 * `status: "unavailable"`.

 * Wrap a successful upstream feed result in the uniform envelope.

 *   `dataQualityWarnings` are present (either supplied via `result` or
 *   passed explicitly), otherwise `"operational"`.
 * - `data` is normalized to the same array reference as `items` so
 *   consumers reading the legacy `data` field always see an array.
 * - Existing `dataQualityWarnings` from `result` are preserved and
 *   merged with any explicitly-supplied warnings (rather than
 *   clobbered).
 *
 * @param result - Raw upstream response payload (may contain `data`,
 *                 `@context`, and optionally `dataQualityWarnings`)
 * @param warnings - Optional extra data-quality warnings to merge into
 *                   the response. When non-empty, `status` is derived
 *                   as `"degraded"`.
 * @returns MCP-compliant ToolResult containing the uniform envelope
